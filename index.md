  description: Impact mapping is a lightweight, collaborative planning technique for teams that want to make a big impact with software products. It is based on user interaction design, outcome driven planning and mind mapping. Impact maps help delivery teams and stakeholders visualise roadmaps, explain how deliverables connect to user needs, and communicate how user outcomes relate to higher level organisational goals.

      Impact mapping is fast, visual and collaborative. It makes it easy to engage people from various roles
      and backgrounds, expose hidden assumptions and document important decisions. It provides just enough
      structure to facilitate effective planning and prioritisation, but does not get in the way with complicated
      syntax or bureaucracy.

      Impact mapping is for product managers, business sponsors and senior technical leadership working
      with iterative software delivery, who want to focus effort, restructure existing
      initiatives or communicate a vision for a new idea.

      Think about behaviour changes that would make a big impact on the users of
      your product, capture them with post-it notes or write down in the middle of a
      whiteboard. Group impacts by actors, personas or user categories. Add
      deliverables that could support those behaviour changes on one side. Add
      organisational goals supported by those impacts on another side. Connect the
      related items visually to create a mind map. Prioritise
      from the goals down to impacts.

    description: | 
      Impact maps usually take the form of a mind map, or a hierarchical outline. Structuring
      information as a mind map allows you to describe many different
      dimensions of a product milestone plan in a single visualisation. Use
      colours, letter type and size, position (hierarchical,
      vertical/horizontal and relative), outline shades and shapes and
      additional symbols such as asterisks to describe importance, priority,
      grouping or impact.
