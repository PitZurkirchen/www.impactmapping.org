  title: What is it?
  description: |
    Impact mapping is a collaborative lightweight planning technique, based on user interaction design 
    and mind mapping, which helps delivery teams and stakeholders visualise roadmaps, 
    explain how deliverables connect to user needs and impacts, and communicate how
    user outcomes relate to higher level organisational goals.
